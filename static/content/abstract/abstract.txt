Visual place recognition (VPR) is a crucial task in robotics and autonomous systems, enabling robots to localize themselves
-in complex and dynamic environments.<br><br>
Due to significant differences in appearance that arise from changes in environmental factors like season,
weather, and lighting (day or night), VPR is particularly challenging in outdoor settings.<br><br>
In order to address this challenge, we are proposing MS-MixVPR, which is proposed based on an existing work, MixVPR. 
The proposed MS-MixVPR extracts global features from different layers of pre-trained CNN backbones using MixVPR's Feature Mixer blocks. 
These visual cues are combined further to create a compact, holistic representation that is highly robust to changes in environmental conditions.<br><br>
We evaluate the proposed MS-MixVPR on four challenging real-world benchmark datasets, including Nordland, SPEDTest, MSLS, and Pittsburgh30k. 
The experimental results show that our MS-MixVPR outperforms several current state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational time. 
Consequently, our approach is suitable for real-world applications that are often resource-constrained.
