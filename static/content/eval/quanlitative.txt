Overall, MS-MixVPR can effectively retrieve images with different
seasonal changes, weather conditions, and viewpoints. It is also robust to illumination changes and dynamic objects and can handle perceptual aliasing and repetitive
structures. In contrast, other methods often fail to capture these variations and produce less relevant results. <br>
There are a few cases where all methods fail to retrieve relevant images. These cases typically involve non-discriminative content or extreme
environments for detection.
