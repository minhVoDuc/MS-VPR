Performance comparison between MS-MixVPR and several approaches (MixVPR, CosPlace, Conv-AP, NetVLAD) in
terms of RecallRate@N across four datasets mentioned above. <br>
We use the checkpoint versions created by the authors with ResNet50 as backbone for all approaches, except
for NetVLAD, which we use the version that was trained using VGG16. <br>
Overall, across all datasets, MS-MixVPR consistently achieves RecallRate@N scores within the <strong>top two<strong> performers.
